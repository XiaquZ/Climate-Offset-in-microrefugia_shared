# Climate-Offset-in-microrefugia_shared
Climate Offset R scripts for sharing 
1. MIs_MinOffset_be.R illustrates how to calculate micorefugia index (MI) based on climate offsets.  
2. Get_quantiles_MATOffset_HPC. R is scripts to extra the quantile value on supercomputer.  
3. Mean_MinTempOffset_SpringWinter_HPC.R is script for supercomputer to calculate the mean of minimum temperature during winter and spring time.
